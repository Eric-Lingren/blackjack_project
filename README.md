Blackjack for card counters is not your average blackjack game.  It is designed to help players become more proficient card counters through training drills and enhanced gameplay.  

This Front-End React site contains a traditional blackjack game and maintains comprehensive game statistics, such as what the player/casino advantage is during any given hand, what the count is and optimal betting amounts based on the players' current advantage.

This  CRUD site makes requests from the Deck of Cards API to maintain the deck, cards dealt, and discarded cards.  All this data is maintained in state after each call and it is this data that calculates the correct plays and game stats.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and uses the React Router Dom and Axios packages that need to be installed.
